## P4a — Public surface (landing + ghost-list scaffold + SEO)

**Shipped:** 2026-05-03 (branch `feat/public-surface`, tag `v0.4.0a-public-surface`)
**Plan:** [plans/2026-05-03-public-surface.md](plans/2026-05-03-public-surface.md)
**Spec:** [specs/2026-05-03-public-surface-design.md](specs/2026-05-03-public-surface-design.md)
**Test suite:** 286 passing (234 from prior phases + 52 new across noindex audit, a11y, SEO, UTM, ghost-list model, basic-auth bypass, and landing view).

| # | Task | Done | Commit |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Settings — `PUBLIC_GHOST_LIST_ENABLED`, `CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`, sitemap/robots whitelist | [x] | `e49c6be` (+ `48e4c6f` `.env.example`) |
| 2 | `PublicSearchEntry` model + migration + 7 model tests | [x] | `393fcca` |
| 3 | `AdminApplication` UTM fields + admin filter + purge() guard | [x] | `353b002` |
| 4 | `BasicAuthMiddleware` bypass for public paths (exact-match + prefix) | [x] | `4ac680b` |
| 5 | UTM capture in `signup_view` (sanitization + session stash) | [x] | `a3b3742` |
| 6 | `/sitemap.xml` exposing landing + inscription only | [x] | `41e3186` |
| 7 | `/robots.txt` with explicit allow/disallow + sitemap reference | [x] | `484fbaa` |
| 8 | `PublicSearchEntry` admin registration with 2-cosigner UX | [x] | `860f212` |
| 9 | Landing view + template (hero, ghost section, OG/JSON-LD, namespaced URLs, year sort) | [x] | `0615459` |
| 10 | Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon (anonymous-only, env-gated) | [x] | `7a0a3fc` |
| 11 | Noindex audit + landing a11y assertions (5+4 tests) | [x] | `505a82f` |
| 12 | Full suite + smoke + STATUS update | [x] | _this commit_ |
| 13 | Merge, tag, push, deploy | _next commit_ | _pending_ |

**Notable design decisions:**
- Ghost list section is gated by env-var feature flag `PUBLIC_GHOST_LIST_ENABLED` (default off). RGPD safety net so admin signoffs can't accidentally publish names before P4b's removal flow ships.
- Two-admin M2M publication gate enforced at queryset level (no single-toggle boolean).
- UTM fields kept on `AdminApplication` after `purge()` (aggregate labels with no PII); `referrer` cleared (group-invite URLs leak membership).
- `protocol = "https"` hardcoded on the sitemap class to force https://-prefixed URLs even when Django receives the request over plain HTTP behind Railway's TLS proxy.
- Open Graph image at `static/img/og-landing.png` is a 1×1 placeholder; replace with a real 1200×630 PNG before deploy.
- Narrative copy in the landing template is the implementer's first-draft placeholder; team to refine before deploy.

## P4b — Public surface (token-based removal flow + AuditLog)

**Shipped:** 2026-05-03 (branch `feat/public-surface-governance`, tag `v0.4.0b-public-surface-governance`)
**Plan:** [plans/2026-05-03-public-surface-governance.md](plans/2026-05-03-public-surface-governance.md)
**Spec:** [specs/2026-05-03-public-surface-governance-design.md](specs/2026-05-03-public-surface-governance-design.md)
**Test suite:** 324 passing (286 from prior phases + 38 new across audit log, removal request, signals, view, email, landing template tests).

| # | Task | Done | Commit |
|---|------|------|--------|
| 1 | Whitelist /retrait/ for login + basic-auth bypass | [x] | `8efdf41` |
| 2 | AuditLog model + migration + tests | [x] | `3f009ff` |
| 3 | RemovalRequest model + tighten removal_token + tests | [x] | `e390cc1` |
| 4 | Audit signal handlers (entry create, signoff M2M, request cancel) | [x] | `4eecfc4` |
| 5 | 3 removal-flow email templates + senders | [x] | `bbdaebb` |
| 6 | Public removal request form view + done page | [x] | `968722d` |
| 7 | Removal confirmation view (idempotent auto-execute) + expired page | [x] | `61fde34` |
| 8 | RemovalRequestAdmin + AuditLogAdmin (append-only) | [x] | `d4e58e3` |
| 9 | Landing template "Retirer mon nom" link in each ghost card | [x] | `d5f1f72` |
| 10 | Full suite + STATUS update | [x] | _this commit_ |
| 11 | Merge, tag, push, deploy | _next commit_ | _pending_ |

**Notable design decisions:**
- "sans débat" interpretation: auto-execute on email confirmation. No admin gatekeeping.
- 30-day expiry on RemovalRequest aligns with GDPR Art. 12's one-month response window.
- AuditLog populated automatically via Django signals so adding a new way to sign off / remove an entry doesn't require remembering to write to AuditLog.
- P3 cooptation actions are NOT retrofitted into AuditLog — domain audit fields stay where they are.
- Custom admin governance UI and quarterly review automation deferred to P4c.

## How to update

- When a phase plan is written: link it in the Phase Index and in that phase's section.
- When a task within a phase ships: tick its checkbox and add the short commit SHA.
- When a phase ships: set status to `Complete`, add the date and milestone tag, and confirm test count.
